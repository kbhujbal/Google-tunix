"""RLOO (REINFORCE Leave-One-Out) learner.

RLOO is a variance-reduced policy gradient method that uses leave-one-out
baselines. For each completion in a group, the baseline is the mean reward
of all *other* completions to the same prompt. This yields an unbiased
advantage estimator with lower variance than the group-mean baseline used
in standard GRPO, without requiring a separate critic network.

  """Configuration for RLOO (REINFORCE Leave-One-Out).

  RLOO replaces GRPO's group-mean advantage estimator with a leave-one-out
  baseline, which provides lower variance while remaining unbiased. The
  advantage for each completion is computed as its reward minus the mean
  reward of all other completions to the same prompt.

  This is particularly effective when ``num_generations`` is moderate (4-16),
  as the leave-one-out baseline becomes more accurate with more samples.

  Attributes:
    algo_variant: The algorithm variant identifier. Always ``rloo``.
    advantage_estimator: The advantage estimator to use. Always ``rloo``.
    loss_agg_mode: The aggregation mode for the loss function. Defaults to
      ``token-mean`` following the RLOO paper's recommendation for
      token-level normalization.

  """RLOO (REINFORCE Leave-One-Out) learner.

  RLOO is a reinforcement learning algorithm that improves upon GRPO by using
  leave-one-out baselines for advantage estimation. For each completion in a
  group, the baseline is the average reward of all *other* completions to
  the same prompt, rather than the group mean (which includes the completion
  itself).

  This approach:
    - Produces unbiased advantage estimates (like GRPO).
    - Achieves lower variance than the standard group-mean baseline.
    - Requires no additional model parameters (unlike PPO's critic).
    - Is most effective with moderate group sizes (4-16 generations).

  The learner inherits the full GRPO training loop, including clipped
  importance sampling, optional KL penalty, and multi-iteration support.
  Only the advantage computation differs.

      rloo_config = RLOOConfig(
          num_generations=8,
